## Introduction

Welcome to "yet another web3 auditor roadmap". I am creating this as an overarching simplified roadmap for me to follow on my web3 security auditing journey. This is in no way an end-all-be-all source of information to follow, as there is so many different guides, tutorials, video series, etc. to take in the space it would be impossible to create a roadmap that makes sense for every individual. This one prioritizes jumping into getting your hands dirty while also assisting me in creating my own methodology and helping develop my thought process while going through a codebase.

Keep this [link](https://solidity-by-example.org/) by your side throughout this process as well.

### Tips on Taking Notes & Reflecting on Findings to Improve your Methodology

Throughout this process take detailed notes, especially on the security sections. Once you start getting into the shadow audits and you're walking through previous reports, ask yourself how you'd find the vulnerability in that situation. It isn't enough to understand the vulnerability and the exploit, but you also need to understand how to find it in the first place. Incorporate this thought process into your note taking and you'll be able to start to develop your methodology.

## Phase 1 - Learning the Basics

* [ ] Read or listen to "[Read Write Own](https://readwriteown.com/)" by Chris Dixon
* [ ] Read "[Mastering Ethereum](https://aantonop.com/books/mastering-ethereum/)" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Gavin Wood
* [ ] Complete the "Blockchain Basics" course @ [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/dashboard)
* [ ] Complete the "Solidity 101" course @ Cyfrin Updraft

## Phase 2 - Utilizing Solidity

* [ ] Complete the "Foundry 101" course @ Cyfrin Updraft
* [ ] Complete the "Advanced Foundry" course @ Cyfrin Updraft

## Phase 3 - Security Foundations

* [ ] Complete the "Security & Auditing" course @ Cyfrin Updraft
* [ ] Complete the "[Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/)" challenges and write them up
* [ ] Complete the "[Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)" challenges and write them up

## Phase 4 - Advanced Security

* [ ] Complete the [IntoGateway Web3 Security Course](https://guardianaudits.notion.site/Gateway-Free-Web3-Security-Course-574f4d819c144d7895cda6d61ba26503) created by [Guardian Audits](https://guardianaudits.com/)

## Phase 5 - Getting Hands-On

* [ ] Read _**three**_ previous audit reports and write them up (shadow audit).

Suggestions:

* Jpeg'd
* Beedlefi
* DoraFactory
* JuiceBox v4
* More previous audit reports and other good vulnerability resources can be found @ [Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/).

<!---->

* [ ] Compete in _**three**_ contests

Suggestions:

* Low SLOC
  * Below 500 for the first two contests
  * Below 1000 for the third contest
* [CodeHawks First Flights](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/first-flights?community-judging=true\&ended=true\&judging=true\&live=true\&sort=endDate\&upcoming=true) are a great testing ground
  * There is also [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/welcome), [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), etc.
